# Trax - SEND YO TRAX OUT! 

Trax is a on the fly playlist generator for youtube and soundcloud media. Traxlists can be quickly generated and shared with your friends. Give them unique names and edit them later for a rotation playlist of awesome! 
There is also support for music subreddits. Trax also supports subreddits so you can listen to your favorite subreddits with ease.

## How to use:
Check out http://trax.im for a live version. Paste a soundcloud sound url or youtube video link (can be audio or video) into the box and press enter.
Once you've curiated your traxlist click "Save Traxlist" which will copy the traxlist share url to your clipboard and take you to the edit page for that traxlist (note the key in the url for later editing).
To listen to your favorite subreddits use the /r/ endpoint and supply some musical subreddits. I am a fan of http://trax.im/r/futurebeats+futuregarage+indie
